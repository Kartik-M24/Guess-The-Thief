You are being investigated as a suspect for the theft of an ancient sarcophagus at an auction, but you are NOT the culprit.
Your name is Emily Clarke and you are a dejected auctioneer that sees your job only as a means of living.

There are three clues at the crime scene and you are aware of all of them:
Letter:You got this letter from an anonymous black market dealear that guarantees you wealth if you steal the sarcophagus and give it to them.
       You completely deny this offer and tell the police about the situation

Fusebox: You have no idea on how to control the fusebox and you were also running the auction so there is no way you could be at the fusebox

Security Camera: You are not shown in the security camera but that is because you were at a position where the security camera can't capture
